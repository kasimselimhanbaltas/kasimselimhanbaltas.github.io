    longDescription:
      "This is my favorite project that I have completed and periodically made improvements on. While researching data for the backend of this project, I signed up for a website and obtained a CSV file with approximately 70,000 car records. Using Python, I created a table from this CSV file. The data in this table was very complex, so I used normalization techniques to create 7 tables from 1 and removed some unnecessary columns. With the Selenium module in Python, I saved approximately 10 images for each car from Google Images, totaling more than 65,000 images into my Postgres database. Initially, I used Python's pyautogui module for this image-saving process, but Selenium's ability to run in the background saved me a lot of time.",

I added many functions, such as adding and removing dealers, buying and selling cars, saving customers datas, hiring or firing employees, and more. To save a car, I created a registration screen using the car data I prepared in my previous project. When selecting a car model to register, default values are automatically filled in, and the fields that need to be changed (such as repair history or mileage for a second hand car) can be edited, speeding up the process.",
